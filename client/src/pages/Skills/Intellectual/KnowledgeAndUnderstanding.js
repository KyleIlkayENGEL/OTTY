          <h2>Passage Title: The Role of Algorithms in Modern Technology</h2>
          <p>
            Algorithms are a set of rules or instructions given to a computer to help it perform tasks. In todayâ€™s world,
            algorithms power everything from search engines and social media feeds to recommendation systems on e-commerce websites.
            These algorithms are designed to process vast amounts of data quickly and make decisions based on patterns and rules.
            However, as algorithms become more pervasive, they also raise significant challenges, including bias in decision-making,
            ethical concerns, and the difficulty of ensuring fairness across diverse populations.
